Am I taken from some former glory
or have I taken root in soil sound?
Shall I live the script which can't be found
or shall I pen of my own story?
A gift I'm meant't, no must, enjoy
is more a burden than a gracious thought
When the present withers into rot,
Love and Gratitude will not employ
'Stead the rot will chip away my shell,
my looking glass patiently cracked
With the final tick, a final talk,
I flourish freely from my stagnant hell.
It's now, as I marvel from above,
basking in embrace of noon-day sun
The pain you gave, I appreciated none;
born, not of malice, but grown in love.
