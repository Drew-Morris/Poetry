If a bridge burns
and no one turns to see it
Do her embers glow?

If a bridge burns
and no one turns to hear it
Do her cables crow?

If a bridge burns
and no one turns to smell it
Do her ashes snow?

If a bridge burns
and no one turns to feel it
Do her breaths flow?

One might implore
"A bridge does more
than stitch a great divide?"
From end to end,
a bridge will mend
past pains ingrained inside.
"But bridges fault
and bring tumult."
In that you are correct.
A bridge will bond
'crossed abyssal ponds
to trust and to connect.

It takes but one
- lowly torch -
to set a bridge a ablaze
In hungry sun,
remains scorch
by careless angry haze
*a sudden stun*
(stomach lurched)
My eyes melt past their g(l)aze
Is this fun?
Is this church?
I am lucid || I am dazed

  Embers Glow

  Cables Crow

  Ashes Snow

  Breaths Flow

  But

If when a bridge burns
all who turn burn with it
Will anyone ever know?
