Here I sail,
'cross a sea of memory
A breeze guideth me along
my sturdy hull
It stirs the current, freeing
time I'd lost to song
Sung in times of day,
feeding the coasting trees,
and relinquishing my wrongs.
For when clouds cry hail,
and flee by flight the geese
From Conscious to ayawn
Up the current they scale
From deep beneath the sea
Kind memory resurface,
I had lost for so long.
