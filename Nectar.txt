I am a flourist:
tending to wilted flowers
just one at a time
Drop by glist'ning drop,
I water their tangled roots:
freeing them of knots
With every new day,
their petals breathe deep and sigh:
blooming in sunlight
I feed from my heart:
a river of red nectar
bleeding from my palms.
Each cut carved with care
to nurture a frail flower
as my vision fades.
The bell's prelude rings
soft and shrill. Creeping inside
my ears: paralyzed.
Brooks yield waterfalls;
with one incision too much,
I gave all of me.
As skies turn ashen,
fading to dusk before me,
alight nevermore.
The flower stands tall
deserting me: my last frame
tragicly alone.
After countless moons,
I arise: mine memories blank:
probably misplaced.
A bud lies withered;
I cradle them in warmth, for
I am a flourist.
