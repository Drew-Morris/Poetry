Resting 'cross the leaves
bathing in the sun
A little caterpillar
she steps, one by one
The overseeing gardener
noting her concerns
The caterpillar's brood
had all matured without her
She took her in her hands
Nurtured her with care
to feed a growing confidence
to shed her fears so bare
But t'embrace the chrysalid
for the final change in fright
to be reborn in love
a birth of shimm'ring twilight
Such a thought feeds terror
in the caterpillar's mind
What will I become?
Will absence brace my side?
The gardener softly spoke
and cradled her so kind
embracing her in warmth
Found comfort in choices blind
In this she built her chrysalid
by thread: by fragile thread
glistening in hope
of a future flight, not fled
