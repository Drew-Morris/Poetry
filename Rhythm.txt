Interesting how timing works isn't it?

Lazily marching along
Off-Beat to your liking with a
Volition to run
Ever so slightly ahead - or rhythmically behind.

Youth decays by its hand:
Onerously gifted to wisdom, hoping to
Understand where we've been.

I hope to sail towards my visions; the
Sea oft sees differently but sailing is
A love unto itself.
