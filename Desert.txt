Oh what a feeling
seeing that old friend
for the first time
in how many years?
Oh the memories
that you share:
a tapestry of
laughter, tears, comfort.
Oh what a familiar feeling.

And yet
this time around,

When we'd normally
pass each other by,
share a conversation
over a meaningless drink,
present our curation
of our past few years,
hoping to connect
but not too much
as to reveal the
troubled, vulnerable,
humanity inside.

we stayed.
When the sun set
the applause ceased
and the curtains
came to their close,
for once
the world stood still.
For once,
we didn't have to leave.
We didn't have to hide.

We shared
buttons, cds, stickers,
memories, pains, fears,
food, jokes, time,
laughter, tears, comfort.
In you, I found a friend.
Oh what a novelty
to discover
a new friend
in one old.

And now as it seems
the world has had its rest
and the time has come
for her to move again,
I am afraid.

I wish to stay
in this timeless haven
sharing little things,
trinkets, mementos, souvenirs,
thoughts, feelings, loves,
laughter, tears, comfort.

And yet,
I can aleady feel
the earth moving beneath us.
I'll be gone soon, but
I ask you hold this sentiment
until we meet again.

Oh how I thought I had known you
and how glad I am to have been wrong.
