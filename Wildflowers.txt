Fields of barren soil:
dry, brittle, cold
It's reach spans far from sight
with artifacts of roots
With every rain, is born,
a child's hopeful seed
But as the dew drops fade
so too, the nascent sprouts
Though settlement is sparse
and trails, hardly trodden
Mine earth has known the boot.
Unyielding. Unforgiving.
As such, she's crusted over
with clay: steelen, rusted
Between its seams e'er peering
Shielded, growing weary
And just as rotten tendrils
had grasp'd her core, decrepit
A traveler meandered
'cross this: mine barren land.
Jumping from her pockets,
sweet sunflower seeds
nestling 'twixt my grooves
settling 'neath my seams.
In this, 'twas nothing special
for seeds had fallen before;
starving for proper care,
they withered in neglect.
But as fell these new seeds
this traveler stopped and stared
She blanketed the soil
o'er hope: tucked in with care
The earth began to soften
but feared of quick departure;
but love had staked a tent
for the traveler, no more.
Through day on day on day,
she tended tender ground
peeling back the pain
warming silken soil
Seeds grew into sprouts
with newly fragile roots
Her fingers trace their leaves
fed by her shining smile
And day by day by day
she tilled the fertile loam
'til sturdy stalks stood tall
and fruiting blossoms bloomed
Miraculous in deed
a land devoid, deserted;
agrin with lavish green
now holding tight her hand
with every step, she follows:
her field of wildflowers.
