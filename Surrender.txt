Oh how your fingers draw your name
across my tender skin
In your hands, you stir my flame
left begging once again
I feel my troubles fade away
in what I thought was sin
Gods gift to me, a woodland fae
such things do make her grin
Her seeds stand sprouted solemnly
with flowers in my ears,
and with one stroke across their petals;
my pain has disappeared
I'm gladly lost in servitude
I sing at her command
Surrendering my melting will:
a good girl in her hands.
