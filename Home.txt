Sorry I missed you
I'm not home right now
I've left to go explore
in search of who I am
I should return soon
with smile or with frown,
walking cross the floor
or riding in by tram
Returning with a truth
so saddened to be found
I'd though was far from shore
was craded by the lamb
"Home is where I am."
No more could I be wrong
For home you cannot find
It whispers out in song
You can search far and wide
no matter weak or strong
Try and build your own
but it won't last for long
"Home finds you"
in sickness and in health
Home cares for you
when life is all but hell
Home laughs with you
when all you see are tears
Home comforts you
when all you feel is fear
Home talks to you
when loneliness abounds
Home hushes you
when tongues brandish sound
Home repairs you
when cracking is your ground
Home grows with you
for dreams both soft and loud
Now that I'm far from home
an emptiness is left
I'm sorry I missed the phone
I'm running out of breath
I'm lost: so far from view
For my Home is with you.
