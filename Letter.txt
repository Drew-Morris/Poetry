Hi there.
You've come here once again.
Although,
I only see you now and then
and you
are always welcome, my friend.
So soon
these moments end.

Why huddle in fear
for the journey yet to come?
Your people are still near
to teach you all and some.
We are proud
of the person you've become.
So why aren't you?

You've nothing in your eyes:
head empty, heart dry,
skin hardly clinging
to your bones,
nails, short and bleeding,
lungs hardly breathing.
Dear, you are fading
by the hour.
This isn't fair
so why do you care
for everyone but me
and why can't you see
I love you.
I do.
So please,
child,
come home.
