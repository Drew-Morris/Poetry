Today of all days:
overcast and gray,
tears of light rain.
"It's been a while..."
since my thoughts (a pile)
have sailed the Nile.
God it feels good
to be understood.
God this feels good.
Oh for so long,
a quivering song,
I held onto: wrong.
I had moved on.
My past? Dead and gone:
no more than a yawn.
But with this spade
I dug through the shade:
shaking, afraid.
This treasure I'll find
in the back of my mind
will surely crush my spine.
She gifted me pain;
she left me stained
and yet I'm to see her again?
We leave our old habits
behind with the rabbits
from the hats that fooled us before.
But I need resolve
so I can evolve;
else I slowly dissolve.
So I brandish my blade
and cut through the glade
protecting me from harm
to talk to... a friend?
(an unexpected end)
When did these frays mend?
Where are my memories
of enslaved reverie?
Have they been wiped clean?
What once was singed
deep in my skin,
my branding scars are stolen by the wind.
Oh God I missed you.
Why did I miss you?
Why did I miss you
enough to remember my shoes?
And why has this left me so confused?
I brough a jacket, umbrellas, rain boots
and you brought out the Sun.
God it feels good
to talk like we should.
God this feels good.
I just hope
I haven't fucked this up for good.
