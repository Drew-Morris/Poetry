They think I'm crazy
for not understanding
They think I'm crazy.
why I feel the ways I do.
They think I'm crazy
for feeling pain,
They think I'm crazy.
for shutting down,
They think I'm crazy.
when I'm confused.
They think I'm crazy
for feeling sick
They think I'm crazy.
when I read what I've written.
They think I'm crazy
for diving deep
They think I'm crazy.
into my darkest fears.
They think I'm crazy
when the noise,
They think I'm crazy.
when the lights,
They think I'm crazy.
when the sensations,
They think I'm crazy.
drive me to tears.
They think I'm crazy
when everything
They think I'm crazy.
crashes down
They think I'm crazy.
around me.
They think I'm crazy
when everything
They think I'm crazy.
is just too much.
They think I'm crazy.
...
...
...
It hurts
