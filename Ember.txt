A forest, dark and lonely
no starshine 'twixt the leaves
A cigarette glows between
the fingers it is sheathed
A figure in the distance
Too, alone it stands
wandering in silence
dancing my same dance
I run to their embrace
and in my clumsy haste
The glow falls far from grace
and flame roars in place
Surrounded, I should fear
the pain I'm told, I hear
But while my body sears,
I shed one lonely tear
As ash falls, I've been blind
to faults of mine own mind
A past I'd leave behind
to love the one who's kind
For through the pain of mourning
with memories from me torn
This pain pales to our spring,
for in your flame, I am warm.
