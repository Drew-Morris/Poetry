Why can't I be happy alone?

Why can't I wander the shore,
skipping the occasional stone,
without drowning in mental horror
lest someone clutches my hand?

Why do I suffocate,
silenced as I stand,
in this innate state
loneliness surrounds me,
envelopes me,
enshrouds me,
abounds in me.

Loneliness is most all I've known.
And I've never escaped its grasp
for long. As each light shone
through, it's snuffed as I gasp:
quickly choking down anything,
any semblance of care.

For it will be long until the next spring
and there are few more winters I can bear.
