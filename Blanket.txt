Standing on an overpass,
the world beneath my hands
My mind is joyous
for those dear to me
My heart never understands
How is it that so many things
can go right
and why can I be
exactly who I want to
and not acquaint happiness
I'm uncertain what's unside
Abundant love
or tumultuous tide
To me, there's no regard
I find myself upon this roof
with stars between my eyes
and all I wish to do
is shout what lies inside
Even if one heard me:
in silence or in sound
None would turn to listen
B'fore the tree strikes the ground
Thus I stand on the overpass
My back, now to the world
Whilst I embrace a void
For at least I'll again be held.
