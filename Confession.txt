A raven quill, spurned by Rose's
red ink that paints my confession
Aromatic trills singing sweet
from my cindered tongue
These words I savor, for
follows grave impressions
Spoken fickle icicles
when my leaves were young
Watering my Roses
when Lily's yet to bloom
For her petals hug
like a bowl of warm soup
Could roots wither easier
if It wasn't true?
As true as the sea is deep
and as tea must brew
No matter how, nor why, nor whom
I simply lost the key
Never wanting desire for escape
from this calming deep.
For I have fallen well:
Ever in love, with You.
