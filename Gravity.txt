The raven walks akin
to a field-meandering brook
pebbles 'neath their feet
their innocence, from them, took
For wind beneath their wings
'twas merely lullaby
and as this song did fade,
Clipped feathers broke their pride
Plummeting from the sky,
a meteor aglow
the soft Earth did cradle
next the wandering crow.
"The sky paints with roses,
but Earth will never drop you."
So, with fingers intertwined,
they wandered the same tune.
For hours upon hours,
singing sweet as chartreuse,
but time does cease for none
and soon arrived Crow's house.
Poor raven journeyed on
to build a house redrawn,
but as their wings drew out,
was heard a distant song.
"Though house I have at hand,
and roots I've deeply grown,
my hearth is cold and empty.
Only with you, am I home."
This melody, a blanket,
in storms of rolling thunder
and though they sleep apart,
A moon conjoins their slumber
with dreams and mem'ries fond
Mouths waltzing a grin.
So, as the sun rises,
The Raven walks again.
