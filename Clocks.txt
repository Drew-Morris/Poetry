Tick. Tick. Tick

I'd planned a visit today
to revisit the overpass;
somehow I'd forgotten
and my mind knows it.
Instead, I wandered astray
to an ocean of grass:
a sea never-trodden
where moths ever-flit.
It's not a grand palace,
subtle and serene,
mine fateful destination.
So why do I still hear it?

Tick. Tick. Tick

It's strange to meet your gaze
and fail to recognize them.
Those eyes, those lips, those
unruly hairs 'cross that brow
...of mine?
Then again, I've been convinced for ages
to hate it.
Now I gaze into a glassen pond
and that familiar bitterness has lost its taste;
however, still that piercing visage
is peculiarly unshapen.
I rise, stirring awake the fronds,
my mind unhazed
and my mouth agape.
To early, is today,
to have stumbled upon this place.

Tick. Tick. Tick

Here is where I belong.
Here is where I wish to be.
Why must their remain clay to mold?
My hands have yet more to see.
It feels... wrong
to walk away, to leave,
to throw myself back to the cold,
now that I'm finally warm:
now that I'm finally free.
Sure, my wings have yet to sprout.
Am I sure I'm meant to fly?
I could remain as I am: clay.
Even so, I know this is not yet my home.
I've letters left to write
and pages clean of ink.

Tick. Tick. Tick

Past worries I now flout
as I sow my seared seeds to loam.
Towards a future no more bright,
my ship I gladly sink.
I swing 'round racing gears again:
towards tormenting anxiety,
towards torturous abandon,
risking far more than a glance.
"How expectedly tragic"
I hear their leers whisper,
but their rosy eyes are clouded
and their concerns, misguided.
For while I am still wise,
I will aid my fellow maggots
for they are butterflies.

Tick. Tick. Tick.
