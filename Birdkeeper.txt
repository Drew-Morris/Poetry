When I was just a boy,
at my door, was left, a bird
sitting in its cage
two bows: blue and white
and pink, the third.
I brought it to my room
and hid them far away
for "Birds are a dangerous thing."
flying everywhere
but content in a cage.
I fed them day by day
as all good keepers do.
"I was only curious."
(A thought I'd fed myself
to hide my naive view)
As I saw my bird grow
- so healthy, so strong - 
I saw them grow sad:
feeling trapped and alone,
no place to belong.
They had to be set free
to grow a way anew:
a second birth:
my rebirth:
like grass with glowing dew.
And thus, the cage, I opened
to set my bird free
but as she stepped outside,
attempting to fly,
she fell against her feet.
So here I lie with her,
no longer a bird keeper 
but tending to my bird,
learning to fly
so she may, 
one day,
shatter fear.
