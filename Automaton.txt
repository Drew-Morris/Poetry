A curse I'd been bestowed when I, a babe,
knew not the rhythm, the rhyme, the reason
The mind, a grand illistrious machine
of which mine yearns to be,
but she rusts with every turning season
with greenery encroaching from the glade
Never once did want live as me
And with this fog, she never rests serene
Fear grows; she know her song sirens the grave
but it's all her soul can feed on
And so she turns
And turns
And turns
I hopes for joy: such sweet futility
From sweat and blood grows a mighty tree
of which it's branches flower ever-barren
baring not the weight of life
but not facing the fear of death
To live is To burn; This -in pain- I writhe
If only to breathe a single breathe
So turn her cogs for days on end;
her joints and axles e'er-decay
And though I know life to be a friend,
Her gears will crack 'til visions fade to black.
