Just breathe.
The air's never been colder.
Just breathe.
Its sickles sting your throat.
Just breathe.
Culling pain behind the curtain.
Just breathe.
In fog and clouds of smoke.
Just breathe.
Weighted thoughts shattering your shoulder.
Just breathe.
There's no sense in growing older.
Just breathe.
Let go of Sisyphus's boulder.
Just breathe.
