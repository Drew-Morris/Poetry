Walk the winding spider's web
its threads wrap 'round your feet
Construction seems to say
there're many friends to meet
Some push along a strand
and fade far from sight
Some cut themselves free
and fall a featherless flight
Why must one assert
the nature of its birth
All are born into her
None have, outside, died
Eyes and clouds are one
Thought and Rot, likewise
for we have forgotten
to embrace our ground: to cry
Watch the wires beneath us
Far deep its fractals flow
Convergent to a center,
tenderness will grow
Expanse ad infinitum
In tedium, outstretched
A contradictory structure
abstract and concrete
fragile but complete
In this, there is beauty
though odd and misbehaved
Devoid of all descriptors
To observers, it's a slave
And the deeper we seem to see
the more it seems to me
the web exists eternal
yet hasn't come to be
Absurdity abounds
All falls into question
What's past, to come, and now
Am I my own perception
Can anything be answered
Is knowledge sought in vain
Is to pursue progress
to be a categorical slave
No
Not yet
For none exist in passing
by reflection or design
We are only who we make
by decision and design
The web, in its non-descript
Allows one to explore
To live and love and magnify
Creation evermore
And so the saying goes
"Life's a bitch and then you die."
Hope's persistence sows
That we still live in the meantime.
