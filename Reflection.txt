Every so often I find
I find myself wondering
Whose hands are these?
These hands have seen the sting
of harsh winter's breeze
and still their fingers sing
in letters to the blind.
They trace a body. Cold
Their dance entraps my gaze
This memory, familiar
They lift my view from haze
I see it in a mmirror
My eyes set ablaze
Myself, a shuddering fold
These hands are mine
Those eyes, are too, the same
I think therefore I am
A sick and twisted game
For in this, I am damned
Existing, but in shame
For I love to think
But I hate to be.
