Just another face
Glass eyes in a crowd
This wet floor sign
with the bottle full again
Just wear the mask
Pull over your hood
Survive today
Dump it at home
But the words are loud:
sharper than ever
Right on queue,
the pressure grows
A fear-filled omen
But I swallow it all
I can't let them know
Suppose they did
Would they treat me this way
If they understood
it takes the all of me:
Every Single Thread
to endure another day
And with every word
they speak to me,
I'm filled with dread
as they sever my precious threads.
